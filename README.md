# valuation
My first step to different company valuation method and strategies that I found. 
## AMD Markov Returns Excel
- Extracted 20 years worth of AMD's stock price data from Yahoo Finance. 
- Get daily returns and prove that the returns are nomal and market is efficient.
- If market is not efficient, look at the single transition probabilities and formulate simple strategy that makes more than the simple buy at open and sell at closing each day.

### Result
1. The market is not efficient and the return rate of each day is not random. We can formulate strategy based on this information. 
2. The strategy required for better return is different when you compare 20 years data vs the recent 9 years.
3. Simple buy and sell at opening and closing everyday yields average yearly return of 10% in the recent 9 years. 
4. In the recent 9 years, simple buy at open and sell at closing strategy after relatively high loss day in the previous day results in average yearly return of 35%
5. Bonkers
