# valuation
My first step to different company valuation method and strategies that I found. 
## AMD Markov Returns Excel
- Extracted 20 years worth of AMD's stock price data from Yahoo Finance. 
- Get daily returns and prove that the returns are nomal and market is efficient.
- If market is not efficient, look at the single transition probabilities and formulate simple strategy that makes more than the simple buy at open and sell at closing each day.

### Result
1. The strategy required for better return is different when you compare 20 years data vs the recent 9 years.
2. Simple buy and sell at opening and closing everyday yields average yearly return of 10% in the recent 9 years. 
3. In the recent 9 years, simple buy at open and sell at closing strategy after relatively low return in the previous day results in average yearly return of 35%
